Background & Research
Product Brief
The goal of this project is to release batch redaction - the redaction of multiple documents in
one process
Users will be able to select multiple files and folders and the processDBT-47236: Batch sav
e redacted copiesDONE will directly create redacted copies
They will be able to apply AI categories DBT-46990: Batch redaction by categoriesDONE
and multiple search terms DBT-46991: Batch redaction by search termsDONE
The batch redaction process creates multiple redacted copies without user confirmation of
individual documents or markups
Users are informed via DBT-47237: Reports and NotificationsDONE  about
pre-redaction report: files that can/cannot be redacted before applying redaction 
post-redaction report: files that were not redacted due to missing matches or technical
errors
notifications: the current processMiro board

Problem Discovery
Why are we doing this? And why should we do this now?
Single document redaction is not sufficient when users need to redact a lot of files. Especially in
M&A deals, users have to redact a ton of documents. There is also a need for NPL transactions,
where there is less document variety but lot of quantity.User Personas
Industries
Solution Discovery
Goal and Value Proposition 
Like in with single-document redaction, the value proposition for batch
redaction in a data room lies in its ability to streamline and enhance the
security of document management processes. This feature ensures
compliance with privacy regulations and confidentiality requirements,
mitigating the risk of data breaches and legal liabilities.
By employing batch redaction, users can efficiently hide sensitive information
across multiple documents simultaneously, saving considerable time and
effort compared to manual redaction and single-document redaction. 
Impact
Given that  approximately 66% of our customers consider Redaction as a
must-have (23%) or a nice to have (43%), redaction is very important for us.
Unfortunately, our competitors were the first-movers with redaction. By
offering, batch redaction, we can an advantage against our competitors and
potentially regain lost customers 
User Impact
This section explores how the software can
address user needs, enhance efficiency,
reduce costs, or provide any other positive
outcomes that users are likely to encounter. Company Impact
This may include factors such as increased
revenue, improved operational efficiency,
enhanced reputation, or market differentiation.Success metric
